<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>
The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is the world's
dominant software platform. It is an information space where documents
and other web resources can be accessed through the Internet using a web
browser. The Web has changed people's lives immeasurably. It is the
primary tool billions of people worldwide use to interact on the Internet.[6]

Web resources may be any type of downloadable media. Web pages are
documents interconnected by hypertext links formatted in Hypertext Markup
Language (HTML). The HTML syntax displays embedded hyperlinks with URLs,
which permits users to navigate to other web resources. In addition to
text, web pages may contain references to images, video, audio, and
software components, which are either displayed or internally executed
in the user's web browser to render pages or streams of multimedia
content. Web applications are web pages that function as application
software.
